## Overview

The movie watchlist app allows users to search any movie of their choice using the title and saving their favourites to a watchlist, as a reference.

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- React.JS
- Tailwind CSS
By building this, I tested my knowledge of basic react topics like useState, React Forms and advanced topics like useContext and React Router Dom.

### Continued development
I planned to make this application a full-stack app where it can allow users to store their favourite movies in their Watchlist, which they can visit any time and make changes.
